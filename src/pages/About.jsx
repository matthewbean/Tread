        <p>If the years 2020 through 2021 have taught us anything, it is that being together is never guaranteed. our preconceived habits and routines were challenged through the global pandemic. One way in which this was perceived by many was the inability to go to church. This brought to light the need for a way to commune with other believers without being face to face. For most of us, this meant turning to services like zoom in order to have the communication that we needed. While this worked or meetings and online streaming took care of preaching, there was no great way to interact with the Bible in a communal way.</p>
